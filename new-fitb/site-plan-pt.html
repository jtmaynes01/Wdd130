      <h3>Purpose</h3>

        you tips and tricks for healthy eating habits or even give you an idea
        for a quick exercise. No matter how hopeless you feel, our personal
        trainers are here to help you in your unique goals.

      <h2>Content</h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        This site is for those who is in need of a personal trainer, it gives a
        list of what type of trainer we can offer. With an option to request a
        specific trainer that we don’t have, and our team will find someone for
        you. Whether you are training for a marathon, wanting to try a new
        sport, want to try Yoga, need life coaching, want to lose weight, or get
        stronger we have a network of trainers that can help with your goals.
        People will come to us because we have trainers who are here for you and
        not just to get paid, in the process they will become your friend. The
        main page will tell them why they should get a personal trainer. It also
        will be a way where they can go to the other pages where they can get to
        know the trainers and where they can get easy recipes. I would want to
        put something where they can sign up for a trainer and get started on
        their journey. There will also be pictures and maybe a video that
        inspires others to get a personal trainer. Lastly, there will be a
        section where people who already was with a trainer can tell their
        success story and their experience. This will hopefully motivate others
        to try a trainer for themselves when they see the reviews that our
        website has.

      <h3>Meet A Trainer</h3>
      <p>
        This page is for the users to get to know the trainers that we offer. It
        will show a picture of them, what they train in, and a bio of them. This
        will help gain trust with the user since they know who they will be
        working with for the next couple days, weeks, or months. It will also
        show their social media so the user can see more of what they do on
        their personal page that they can’t see on our page. There could also be
        a link to their Spotify or Apple Music playlist that motivates them when
        they train, in hopes of motivating others to accomplish their goals.
        People want to know if the trainer knows what they are talking about,
        having the bios let others know their story. This builds the trainers
        credibility for them to train the person in need. This can also inspire
        others to also become a part of the network of trainers. Because of this
        I will have a button where they can click to become a trainer. I will
        have another button where others can refer a friend to be a personal
        trainer or to receive a personal trainer.

      <h3>Recipes</h3>
      <p>
        This section of the website is for those people who needs a heather
        option for their meals. It is also for college students who is sick and
        tired of eating mac and cheese and ramen noodles all the time. It could
        also be for frantic moms who wants to feed her army of children without
        them complaining. It will help people be more creative and give them a
        sense of fulfillment when they make something from our website. Who
        doesn’t like eating something they make that was cheap, easy, and
        delicious. It will also have a spot where people can put their family
        recipes where they can share what food brings them joy. Of course, there
        will be pictures to motivate the person to make the food that our
        website offers. There can also be a spot where people can put a review
        of the recipe they tried. People will come to this site since we are
        offering this service for free because we know the struggle of knowing
        what to make.
