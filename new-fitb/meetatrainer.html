        <h2>Bethany Willden</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Bethany Willden. I currently reside in Rexburg, Idaho as a
          student at BYU-Idaho pursuing my major in Therapeutic Recreation. I am
          training to become a fitness trainer and eventually pursue a career in
          adaptive recreation. Growing up doing recreation with friends and
          family, I fell in love with all kinds of recreation. Growing up I did
          years of various types of sports (dance, marching band, and cross
          country) which taught me the importance of staying fit through
          consistency, technique, dedication, and persistence. I also enjoy
          playing the flute, the piano, and the organ. For a couple of years I
          was very sick and was not able to, nor did I feel capable of doing the
          activities and sports that I wanted to do. After a difficult journey,
          I recovered and I was able to get back into shape and feel the best
          and most capable I have ever felt. I believe that everyone should have
          the opportunity of feeling confident and capable in themselves both
          with recreation and with fitness.

        <h2>Blayre Maynes</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, my name is Blayre, I believe our bodies are a blessing and a gift
          and it's important to take care of them- which can be really hard at
          times. I earned my bachelor's degree in Community Health at Eastern
          Washington University. I completed my internship in Arizona at a
          senior living community and loved it with all my heart. Upon moving
          back to Spokane, I started working for the YMCA. I have specialized in
          strength and conditioning for the cancer survivor and personal
          training for individuals over 18 years of age. I have 4 kids and enjoy
          working with other moms who want to become energetic and strong. My
          passion is meeting people where they're at and building from there. I
          want to help you feel better, improve your quality of life, help you
          age well so you can run around with your (future) grandkids, and be
          able to get up off the floor when you're 80 years old!
