<h2>Justin Maynes</h2>
<h3>I wish I had a nickname!</h3>
<p>My name is Justin Maynes and the Career path I want to take is Business Management Operation and maybe Minor in Web Development, but we will see.  </p>
<p>I love playing Pickelball, going on dates, watching Movies/TV Shows, and I love laughing!</p>
<p>The thing I love the most about BYUI is the students and the facility, they are so nice and loving.</p>
<p>The advantage I see is that I can help the buisness I work for have a nice looking website which will help me find and keep a job with this skill  I obtain. I hope to grow a love for web development.  </p>
<p>I have been a member my whole life so for 21 years! (counting the 8 years before Baptism)</p>
<p>My favorite scripture is Helaman 5:12 it is a classic one but soo important and applicable.</p>
